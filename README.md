Nodeca itself is not expected for wide use. It's intended to replace old
[RC Design](http://forum.rcdesign.ru) forum software and make programmer's life
more comfortable.

But during development we create a lot of useful and popular packages for
node.js. See organizations of [@puzrin](https://github.com/puzrin/) profile.
Everything we do is published on github. Enjoy!
